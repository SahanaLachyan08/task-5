# Creative Edge Agency - Homepage

This is a clean, modern, and responsive single-page homepage for a fictional creative agency called "Creative Edge." It features a two-column layout, modern CSS styling, and a mobile-first responsive design.



## Features

* **Modern Layout:** Built with CSS Flexbox for a robust and flexible layout.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout seamlessly transitions from a two-column design on desktop to a single-column stack on mobile devices (screens under 768px).
* **Sticky Header:** The navigation bar remains fixed to the top of the page for easy access.
* **Clean UI:** Uses modern design principles like `box-shadow` for depth, CSS transitions for smooth hover effects, and a clean, readable font (Poppins).
* **CSS Variables:** The color scheme is managed using CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for easy theme maintenance and updates.
* **Accessible:** Includes `alt` text for images and `:focus` states for links, ensuring usability for keyboard navigators.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structured using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
* **CSS3:** Styled with modern CSS, including Flexbox, CSS Variables, and Media Queries.
* **Google Fonts:** Imports the "Poppins" font for typography.
